## Use Cases  
1. **Configuration Management**: Keep configuration files synced across multiple systems.  
2. **Data Logging**: Automatically append and version log files.  
3. **Development Workflows**: Simplify repetitive tasks like committing and pushing changes.

   ```  

## Usage  
Create a configuration file (`config.json`) in the project directory to define your file sync rules:  
```json  
{  
    "files_to_track": ["example.txt"],  
    "sync_interval": 3600  
}  
```  
Run the script:  
```bash  
python codesync.py  
```  

## Example Workflow
